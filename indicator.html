          <p class="indfirst">Our Grade: D  In the Baltimore region there were six times during 2014 when ozone levels exceeded the standard.  The Baltimore metropolitan region is a non-attainment area under the EPAâ€™s 2008 standard for 8-hour ozone levels.</p>

          <p class="contentind">Definition:   This indicator measures the number of times during 2014 when measured levels of ozone exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s standard.  It is an indicator of whether the transportation system is making you and your environment healthy.</p>

          <p class="contentind">Reason:  Ozone is one of four pollutants the U.S. EPA lists as transportation-related.  Ozone in the upper atmosphere is beneficial because it shields the earth from the sunâ€™s ultraviolet radiation, but high concentrations of it at ground level are a major environmental and health concern.  Emissions from cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles help cause ground-level ozone to form.  Breathing ozone can scar your lung tissue, reduce your lung function, and trigger chest pain, coughing, and congestion.  It can worsen asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.</p>
